# How to Use

Use this folder for weekly deliverables documents (e.g., reports, ERD, etc.)

## Week 1:
- [X] TODO in class:
  - [X] create a dev branch
  - [X] fill in the team member information on the main page README.md
  - [X] Schedule weekly team meeting outside class - noon on Friday
  - [X] fill this [form](https://forms.gle/1wSTthcmngdLoCCC7) to get team user accounts created on gwupyterhub and a project database (remember the password you suggested)

- [X] Summary specs
  - [X] Team tasks assignment
    - Applicant portal: Collin
    - Reviewer portal: Alex
    - GS/CAC portal: Will
    - Database design: everyone so we all know what is going on with the database really well
    - Application page/login page: everyone because these are the least work
  - [X] Page layouts 
    - Home page (where applicants, GS/CAC, and reviewers can log in to their respective portals)
    - Applicant portal 
      - where an applicant can see the status of their application
      - can also request reccomendations through a pending application in the portal to a person of their choice
    - Reviewer portal 
      - where a reviewer can see their assigned list of applications for review and review them
      - where a reviewer can submit their recomendation per application
    - GS/CAC portal
      - where a GS can mark transcripts recieved 
      - where a GS/CAC can enter application decision
    - Application page (where a prospective applicant can fill in their information and subsequently receive a UID/password from the system)
- [ ] 5 questions clarifications (open an issue and tag your "project manager")
  - Do we need to worry about committe members in the workflow or do we can we assume the GS/CAC will be the only one that needs access to the database for the final decision
